 Overview This project is a basic security alarm system designed for residential properties using simple electronic components. It simulates how a home security system monitors entry points and alerts occupants when an intrusion is detected.

The system operates in different states and provides real-time feedback through the Serial Monitor, making it ideal for beginners learning embedded systems or Arduino-based projects.

⚙️ Features 🚪 Intruder Detection: A push button acts as a door sensor. When triggered, the system detects a potential intruder.

🔄 System Reset: A reset button allows the user to turn off the alarm and return the system to monitoring mode.

🌙 Night Mode: Automatically activates based on ambient light using an LDR sensor.

💡 Visual Indicators:

Green LED → System monitoring Red LED → Intruder alert 🔊 Audible Alert: A buzzer sounds when an intruder is detected.

🖥️ Serial Monitor Feedback:

MONITORING ACTIVE INTRUDER DETECTED SYSTEM RESET NIGHT MODE ON 🧰 Components Required Breadboard Push buttons ×2 (Door sensor + Reset button) Red LED Green LED Buzzer LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor Resistors and jumper wires 🔌 How It Works When powered on, the system enters monitoring mode, indicated by the green LED and the message MONITORING ACTIVE.

Pressing the door sensor button simulates an intruder:

Red LED turns on Buzzer sounds Serial Monitor displays INTRUDER DETECTED Pressing the reset button:
